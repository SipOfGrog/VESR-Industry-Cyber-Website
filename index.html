      <h2> Do the right thing</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>It is important to do the right thing so I have a good image and that is just who I am.</li>
          <li>This came from my mom as she has always done the right thing in my life and I strive to be just like her.</li>
          <li>Doing the right thing is important because I want to be treated like I treat other people.</li>
          <li>If you do not do the right thing your image will slowly go down as people don't exactly rely on you. You won't get a promotion and you won't have the right people around you.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
      <h2>Respect</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Respect is the foundation of companies and life, you have people you respect for how they got there and what they've done.</li>
          <li>I gained this from my mother she always taught me to listen to people that know what they're doing and I gained respect for them which made me want people to respect me but I have to earn that first.</li>
          <li>Respect is important and I believe it is what holds relationships and companies together is respect for each other.</li>
          <li>If society does not have respect then hierarchies will not be a thing and many businesses will collapse and so will relationships.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
      <h2>Adapting</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>I believe adapting can be benificial to all so you can keep your composure in any situation</li>
          <li>This was gained through doing continuous actions and life and never going the way I wanted to so I had to adapt.</li>
          <li>It is important to adapt because if you don't you will struggle in life and never be able to overcome any challenge that comes your way</li>
          <li>If you can adapt in real life you will not succeed in any part of life especially work and you will not be rellied apon</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
      <h2>Standards</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Standards is how the world rotates if there is not standards there is no regulation and knowing what to expect. </li>
          <li>This value is from my dad, he has instillied in me that there is a standard for everything and if it is not followed you will not be respected.</li>
          <li>Standards are important for society because this are cleaned to a standard things are done to standard so we have balance in life.</li>
          <li>Standards are the foundation for how life is. If you do not follow standards by a minimum you are not respected. That will hurt how people think of you and your image.</li>
